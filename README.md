# HVD
1. datasets:
  - explore the original dataset
  - augment using masking, back-translation, and summarization
  - encode all datasets using DistilBERT
2. compare DistilBERT based classifier performances: using only the premise vs Premise, stance, conclusion
3. compare DistilBERT based classifier on the original dataset vs augmented datasets
4. sklearn classifiers
5. other transformers based model: DeBerta, Roberta, XLnet
6. ensemble transformer models
